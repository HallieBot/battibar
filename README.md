# BattiBar
## A simple tweak to colorize your status bar!

**What is BattiBar?**

BattiBar is a tweak released on Packix repo, by me! It colors your status bar based on the percentage of your battery on a gradient, and was meant to allow your status bar to finally match your theme, and serve a purpose!

**Why am I opensourcing this?**

I'm opensourcing this tweak to allow others to learn from what I have done, as without others opensourcing their work, I would not have been able to release this or WaggleTunes(download on Packix!)

**What is involved?**

This project utilized:
* Theos
* Logos
* Objective-C
* Lots and lots of time.....

**What things do I need as a developer?**

This project utilizes:
* [RemoteLog](https://github.com/Muirey03/RemoteLog)
    * A library to replace NSLog to simplify debugging. Not used in the final release version, but important for developing the tweak. Some users may notice a lag depending on your internet connection.
* [Alderis](https://github.com/hbang/Alderis)
    * A library to help with the color preferences. Instead of implementing my own color picker cell, you can use this library to ease the process!
* [Cephei](https://github.com/hbang/libcephei)
    * A library to simplify the communication with preferences. Modern and easy to learn, it also contains resources such as a Twitter cell.
* [Lacertosus' Preference Cells](https://github.com/LacertosusRepo/Preference-Cell-Examples)
    * The greatest collection of fancified and finished preference cells to make your users experience as clean as possible. I have added modifications to the originals(support for Light/Dark mode, and a few other changes), but all credit goes to the original creator!
